# BIG SKY EARTH Training School April 2016

Data analysis methods in Astronomy and the Geo-Sciences are often surprisingly similar:
they deal with information sources that include both vector and raster streams
and operate in phases that include data integration, modeling and visualization.

As a specific example, similar "Big Data" methodologies are relevant 
for both Astro-informatics, Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing [References?].

We intend this repository as a collection of extensively documented yet executable notebooks 
providing parallel examples of data analytics in separate domains centering on astronomy and the geo-sciences.

Our objective is helping the astronomical and the geoscience communities
interchange ideas and methodologies to
identify and exploit the possibilities for collaboration and cross-pollination.

GitHub now supports [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. 
To contribute to the repository, please feel free to fork it and let us know.
